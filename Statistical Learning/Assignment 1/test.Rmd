We will investigate the medals won by 71 countries in year 2008 in Beijing, 2012 in London and 2016 in in Rio. The dataset contains countries who have won at least one gold medal in each of the last three games. It contains data of their population, GDP (in billions of US dollars) and number of medals won in those years.Here we will use multivariate regression method to predict number of medals won by training the model using various methods.
 
## Task 1:

The libraries to import to do further analysis on data
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(Metrics)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tinytex)
```


The data has been imported into a dataframe (df) by using the **read.csv** function.
```{r}
df = read.csv("medal_pop_gdp_data_statlearn.csv")
```

The first 6 rows of our data will give us some idea about it.
```{r}
head(df)
```

Now, let's look into summary statistics of our data:
```{r}
summary(df)
```

Linear models are a type of model that describes a response variable as a linear combination of predictor variables.Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression. It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables. The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome, target or criterion variable). The variables we are using to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables (or sometimes, the predictor, explanatory or regressor variables).

The multiple linear regression for Y as a function
of X is given by the following equation:
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon, \ \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$
where,
\begin{itemize}
\item $x_1$ and $x_2$ are input variables
\item A scalar constant â€“ $\beta_0$
\item $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ are regression coefficients
\item A residual $\epsilon$ is unknown, but assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and unknown variance:$$\epsilon \sim(0, \sigma^2)$$
\item $Y$ is the target variable
\end{itemize}

In R, we will use glm() function to fit generalized linear models, specified by giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor and a description of the error distribution.
Generalized linear model (GLM) is a generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution like Gaussian distribution.

```{r}
model_train = glm(Medal2012 ~ Population + GDP , data= df)
summary(model_train)
```
Here we have considered two predictor variables which is population and GDP. Medal2012 is our target variable.
The key points to note from the summary are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The regression coefficient of the predictor variable population is $5.247 \times 10^{-9}$ which is very small with the standard error of $7.193 \times 10^{-9}$. The P-value is $0.468$ which is quite large$(0.4682 \gg 0.05)$. This shows that the population of the country is statistically insignificant with regards to country's medal count.
\item On the other hand, the regression coefficient of the predictor variable GDP(7.564e-03) which is relatively large with the standard error of $7.325 \times 10^{-4}$. The P-value is of it is $1.45 \times 10^{-15}$ which is quite small and is less than 0.05$(1.45 \times 10^{-15} \ll 0.05)$. It tells that the GDP of a country is statistically significant and does impact country's medal count.
\item The intercept is $6.076$.
\end{itemize}

To confirm the significance of the predictor variables we calculate confidence interval of their coefficient which is given by:
$$\textrm{C.I.: Estimate} \pm t_c \times \textrm{Standard Error}$$

The t-statistic value$(t_c)$ can be calculated by using $qt$ function. We have 71 data points with one intercept and two regression coefficients. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom will be 71-3 = 68. With $95\%$ confidence interval for which $P(t > t_c) = 0.975$, $t_c$ is calculated.

```{r}
#t-statistic Value 
tc = qt(p=0.975, df=68)

#Confidence Interval of population
pop_ci = summary(model_train)$coefficients[2, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(model_train)$coefficients[2, 2]
print(pop_ci)

#Confidence Interval of gdp
gdp_ci = summary(model_train)$coefficients[3, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(model_train)$coefficients[3, 2]
print(gdp_ci)
```
The following observation is made from the confidence intervals:
\begin{itemize}
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable population$(\beta_1)$ shows that $0$ lies in its range. This confirms the insignificance of the variable with regards to medal count. when $\beta_1=0$, it has no impact on the target variable.
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable gdp$(\beta_2)$ is positive and $0$ does not lie in its range. The values are quite small but it shows some significance. Hence, it does impact our target variable relatively. 
\end{itemize}
 
Considering no change in country's GDP and population, the trained model can now be used to predict medal count for the year 2016(Medal2016) using predict function. The first 10 predicted vs observed values of medal count has been shown below.
```{r}
#Testing model with prediction
model_test=df[,c(2,3)]
pred= predict(model_train, newdata = model_test)
df %>%
  mutate(Pred_Medal2016=round(pred)) %>%
  select(Medal2016,Pred_Medal2016)%>%
  head(10)
```
The plot of predicted vs observed value of Medal2016 gives better insights. The regression line is also fitted in the plot. To see the data points better the axes are log transformed. The plot shows that the data points are quite away from the regression line. The model is performing decently.

```{r}
#Plot with log transformed axes
ggplot(data=df, aes(y=pred, x=Medal2016,label = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Observed VS Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')+
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10')+
  ylab("Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  xlab("Observed Medal Count for 2016")+
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = 'red')+
  geom_text(size=1.5,nudge_y = 0.05,  check_overlap = TRUE)
```

Boxplot of the absolute difference between the predicted and observed values shows 4 outliers. It can be known by finding the 75th quantile and Interquantile range of it using function quantile() 
```{r}
#Boxplot of Absolute error 
boxplot(abs(pred - df$Medal2016))

#Quantile
quantile(abs(pred - df$Medal2016))

#Outliers of Absolute errors: 
#Values Beyond [75th Quantile +(1.5*IQR)]

6.61 + 1.5*IQR(abs(pred - df$Medal2016))  
```
Hence, following 4 countries are outliers with Great Britain having the highest absolute error:
```{r}
#Countries with Absolute Error Outliers
df %>% 
  select(Country,Medal2016) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error = abs(pred - Medal2016)) %>%
  mutate(pred=round(pred)) %>%
  select(Country,Medal2016,pred,Absolute_Error) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error=round(Absolute_Error)) %>%
  filter(Absolute_Error>12.786)%>%
  arrange(desc(Absolute_Error))
```
The model's accuracy can be determined by finding mean absolute error using function $mae()$ and Root mean squared error using function $rmse()$.

```{r}
#Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error
mae(df$Medal2016,pred)
rmse(df$Medal2016,pred)

```
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $6.1043$ and $9.11$ respectively which shows the model is performing decently. 

## Task 2:

We repeat the task $1$ but with log-transformed medal count in 2012 to check and compare the performance of the model with the previous one.

The benefits of the logarithmic transformation are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduces overfitting of data.
\item Less computational power is required.
\item Helps if the distribution is skewed by transforming it. 
\item Improves linearity between predictor and target variables.
\end{itemize}

```{r}
log_of_Medal2012=log(df$Medal2012)
log_model_train = glm(log_of_Medal2012 ~ Population + GDP , data= df)
summary(log_model_train)
```
The following observations could be made from the model:
\begin{itemize}
\item The regression coefficient of the predictor variable population is $1.105 \times 10^{-10}$ which is very small with the standard error of $6.058 \times 10^{-10}$. The P-value is $0.856$ which is quite large $(0.856 \gg 0.05)$. This shows that the population of the country is statistically insignificant with regards to country's medal count.
\item On the other hand, the regression coefficient of the predictor variable GDP (3.161e-04) is relatively large with the standard error of $6.170 \times 10^{-5}$. The P-value is of it is $2.68 \times 10^{-6}$ which is quite small and is less than 0.05$(2.68 \times 10^{-6} \ll 0.05)$. It tells that the GDP of a country is statistically significant and does impact country's medal count.
\item The intercept is $1.569$.
\end{itemize}

```{r}
tc <- qt(p=0.975, df=68)
#Confidence Interval of population
pop_ci_log <- summary(log_model_train)$coefficients[2, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(log_model_train)$coefficients[2, 2]
print(pop_ci_log)
#Confidence Interval of gdp
gdp_ci_log = summary(log_model_train)$coefficients[3, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(log_model_train)$coefficients[3, 2]
print(gdp_ci_log)
```

The following observation is made from the confidence intervals:
\begin{itemize}
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable population$(\beta_1)$ shows that $0$ lies in its range. This confirms the insignificance of the variable with regards to medal count. when $\beta_1=0$, it has no impact on the target variable.
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable gdp$(\beta_2)$ is positive and $0$ does not lie in its range. The values are quite small but it shows some significance. Hence, it does impact our target variable relatively. 
\end{itemize}

Considering no change in country's GDP and population, the trained model can now be used to predict medal count for the year 2016(Medal2016) using predict function. The first 10 predicted vs observed values of medal count has been shown below.
```{r}
log_df <- df[,c(2,3)]
log_predictions <- exp(predict(log_model_train, newdata = log_df))
df %>%
  mutate(Pred_Medal2016=round(log_predictions)) %>%
  select(Medal2016,Pred_Medal2016)%>%
  head(10)
```
The plot of predicted vs observed value of Medal2016 gives better insights. The regression line is also fitted in the plot. To see the data points better the axes are log transformed. The plot shows that the data points are again away from the regression line. The performance of the model has not improved compared to the previous one. Hence, the log transformation of the target variable does not improve the model.

```{r}
#Plot with log transformed axes
ggplot(data=df, aes(y=log_predictions, x=Medal2016,label = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Observed VS Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')+
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10')+
  ylab("Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  xlab("Observed Medal Count for 2016")+
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = 'red')+
  geom_text(size=1.5,nudge_y = 0.05,  check_overlap = TRUE)

```
We again find Outliers by calculating 75th quantile and interquantile range. This time we get 6 outliers with United States having the highest absolute error:
```{r}
#Quantile
quantile(abs(log_predictions - df$Medal2016))

#Outliers of Absolute errors: 
#Values Beyond [75th Quantile +(1.5*IQR)]
8.76 + 1.5*IQR(abs(log_predictions - df$Medal2016))  

#Countries with Absolute Error Outliers
df %>% 
  select(Country,Medal2016) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error = abs(log_predictions - Medal2016)) %>%
  mutate(log_predictions=round(log_predictions)) %>%
  select(Country,Medal2016,log_predictions,Absolute_Error) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error=round(Absolute_Error)) %>%
  filter(Absolute_Error>18.619)%>%
  arrange(desc(Absolute_Error))
```
Mean absolute error and RMSE of the model:

```{r}
#Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error
mae(df$Medal2016,pred)
rmse(df$Medal2016,pred)

```
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $13.70$ and $56.62$ respectively which shows the model isn't performing better than the previous one. 

## Task 3:
We repeat the task $1$ by assuming $Medal2016$ has Poisson distribution and compare the performance of the model with the previous two models.  

The reasons why Poisson Regression model can be considered :
\begin{itemize}
\item The model works best if the data is discrete with non-negative integer values.
\item The outcome are counts of events and occuring randomly  at constant rate.
\item Medals obtained are discrete values with some counts.
\end{itemize}

```{r}
Poisson_Model = glm(Medal2012 ~ Population + GDP , data= df,family = poisson(link='log'))
summary(Poisson_Model)
```
The following observations could be made from the model:
\begin{itemize}
\item The regression coefficient of the predictor variable population is $6.049 \times 10^{-10}$ which is very small with the standard error of $9.131 \times 10^{-11}$. The P-value is $3.48 \times 10^{-11}$ which is quite small $(3.48 \times 10^{-11} \ll 0.05)$. This shows that the population of the country is statistically significant with regards to country's medal count.
\item Also, the regression coefficient of the predictor variable GDP(1.715e-04) is relatively large with the standard error of $6.672 \times 10^{-6}$. The P-value is of it is less than $2 \times 10^{-16}$ which is quite small and is less than 0.05$(2 \times 10^{-16} \ll 0.05)$. It tells that the GDP of a country is statistically significant and does impact country's medal count.
\item The intercept is $2.193$.
\end{itemize}

```{r}
tc = qt(p=0.975, df=68)
#Confidence Interval of population
pop_ci_poi = summary(Poisson_Model)$coefficients[2, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(Poisson_Model)$coefficients[2, 2]
print(pop_ci_poi)
#Confidence Interval of gdp
gdp_ci_poi = summary(Poisson_Model)$coefficients[3, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(Poisson_Model)$coefficients[3, 2]
print(gdp_ci_poi)
```
The following observation is made from the confidence intervals:
\begin{itemize}
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable population$(\beta_1)$ is positive and $0$ does not lie in its range.The values are extremely small but it does shows some significance. This confirms the significance of the variable with regards to medal count. 
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable gdp$(\beta_2)$ is positive and again $0$ does not lie in its range. The values are quite small but it shows some significance. Hence, it does impact our target variable. The values also confirms that GDP is more significant than population.  
\end{itemize}

Considering no change in country's GDP and population, the trained model can now be used to predict medal count for the year 2016(Medal2016) using predict function. The first 10 predicted vs observed values of medal count has been shown below.

```{r}
#Testing model with prediction
poi_df <- df[,c(2,3)]
poi_predictions= predict(Poisson_Model, newdata = poi_df, type = "response")
df %>%
  mutate(Pred_Medal2016=round(poi_predictions)) %>%
  select(Medal2016,Pred_Medal2016)%>%
  head(10)
```
The plot of predicted vs observed value of Medal2016 will again give better insights. The regression line is also fitted in the plot. To see the data points better the axes are log transformed.

The plot shows that the data points are again quite away from the regression line. There are very few data points which are lying on it. The model is performing quite poorly. The slope of the regression line is also more than the previous models.

```{r}
#Plot with log transformed axes
ggplot(data=df, aes(y=poi_predictions, x=Medal2016,label = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Observed VS Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')+
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10')+
  ylab("Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  xlab("Observed Medal Count for 2016")+
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = 'red')+
  geom_text(size=1.5,nudge_y = 0.05,  check_overlap = TRUE)

```
We again find outliers by calculating 75th quantile and interquantile range.

we have 7 outliers with Great Britain having the highest absolute error:

```{r}
#Quantile
quantile(abs(poi_predictions - df$Medal2016))

#Outliers of Absolute errors: 
#Values Beyond [75th Quantile +(1.5*IQR)]

8.33 + 1.5*IQR(abs(poi_predictions - df$Medal2016))  

#Countries with Absolute Error Outliers
df %>% 
  select(Country,Medal2016) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error = abs(poi_predictions - Medal2016)) %>%
  mutate(poi_predictions=round(poi_predictions)) %>%
  select(Country,Medal2016,poi_predictions,Absolute_Error) %>%
  filter(Absolute_Error>15.93)%>%
  arrange(desc(Absolute_Error))

```
Mean absolute error and RMSE of the model:
```{r}
#Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error
mae(df$Medal2016,poi_predictions)
rmse(df$Medal2016,poi_predictions)

```
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $7.85$ and $11.80$ respectively. It also has more absolute error outliers than the previous model.

## Task 4:
Here we will perform negative binomial regression for prediction of $Medal2016$ count. The library needed to perform it is MASS. First of all, we need to find the optimal value of theta and for that we create a function to calculate log-likelihood.

```{r}
logLikelihood <- function(x){
  #logLikelihood for faithful data, with slope of b1 and intercept of 33
  model_nb = glm(Medal2012 ~ Population + GDP , data= df,family = negative.binomial(theta = x))
  Lglk = logLik(model_nb)
  return(Lglk)
}
```
The function will run for the sequence of theta values ranging from 0.001 to 1000. These values are being stored in an array named Lglk.
```{r}
theta = seq(from = 0.01, to = 1000, length.out=1000)
Lglk = rep(NA, 1000) 
for (i in 1:1000){ 
  Lglk[i] = logLikelihood(theta[i])
}
```

Plot of all Log Likelihoods:
```{r}
plot(theta, Lglk, xlab='Slope', ylab='Log Likelihood')
```

To find the optimal value of theta we use the function optim.
```{r}
#print optimal value of theta
nLglk <- function(x){-logLikelihood(x)}
optimise_output = optim(par=1, fn = nLglk)
print(optimise_output$par) #print the optimised slope value
```
The optimal value of theta is 1.54 which can now be used to train our model. 
```{r}
negbin_model = glm(Medal2012 ~ Population + GDP , data= df,family = negative.binomial(theta = 1.54))
summary(negbin_model)
```
The following observations could be made from the model:
\begin{itemize}
\item The regression coefficient of the predictor variable population is $-5.259 \times 10^{-10}$ which is very small with the standard error of $1.252 \times 10^{-10}$. The P-value is $0.365$ which is quite large $(0.365 \gg 0.05)$. This shows that the population of the country is statistically insignificant with regards to country's medal count.
\item Also, the regression coefficient of the predictor variable GDP(4.460e-04) is relatively large with the standard error of $5.691 \times 10^{-5}$. The P-value is of it is $4.33 \times 10^{-11}$ which is quite small and is less than 0.05 $(2 \times 10^{-16} \ll 0.05)$. It tells that the GDP of a country is statistically significant and does impact country's medal count.
\item The intercept is $1.920$.
\end{itemize}

```{r}
tc = qt(p=0.975, df=68)
#Confidence Interval of population
pop_negbin_ci = summary(negbin_model)$coefficients[2, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(negbin_model)$coefficients[2, 2]
print(pop_negbin_ci)
#Confidence Interval of gdp
gdp_negbin_ci = summary(negbin_model)$coefficients[3, 1] +
  c(-1,1)*tc*summary(negbin_model)$coefficients[3, 2]
print(gdp_negbin_ci)
```
The following observation is made from the confidence intervals:
The following observation is made from the confidence intervals:
\begin{itemize}
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable population$(\beta_1)$ shows that $0$ lies in its range. This confirms the insignificance of the variable with regards to medal count. when $\beta_1=0$, it has no impact on the target variable.
\item The confidence interval of the coefficient of the variable gdp$(\beta_2)$ is positive and $0$ does not lie in its range. The values are quite small but it shows some significance. Hence, it does impact our target variable. 
\end{itemize}

Considering no change in country's GDP and population, the trained model can now be used to predict medal count for the year 2016(Medal2016) using predict function. The first 10 predicted vs observed values of medal count has been shown below.
```{r}
#Testing model with prediction
negbin_df <- df[,c(2,3)]
negbin_predictions= predict(negbin_model, newdata = negbin_df, type = "response")
df %>%
  mutate(Pred_Medal2016=round(negbin_predictions)) %>%
  select(Medal2016,Pred_Medal2016)%>%
  head(10)
```
The plot of predicted vs observed value of Medal2016 will again give better insights. The regression line is also fitted in the plot. To see the data points better the axes are log transformed.
```{r}

#Plot with log transformed axes
ggplot(data=df, aes(y=negbin_predictions, x=Medal2016,label = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Observed vs Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')+
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10')+
  ylab("Predicted Medal Count for 2016")+
  xlab("Observed Medal Count for 2016")+
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, col = 'red')+
  geom_text(size=1.5,nudge_y = 0.05,  check_overlap = TRUE)
```
The plot shows that the data points are again quite away from the regression line. There are very few data points which are lying on it. Overall the model is performing decently.
We again find outliers by calculating 75th quantile and interquantile range.

we have 7 outliers with United States having extremely large absolute error:
```{r}
#Quantile
quantile(abs(negbin_predictions - df$Medal2016))

#Outliers of Absolute errors: 
#Values Beyond [75th Quantile +(1.5*IQR)]
6.61 + 1.5*IQR(abs(negbin_predictions - df$Medal2016))  

#Countries with Absolute Error Outliers
df %>% 
  select(Country,Medal2016) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error = abs(negbin_predictions - Medal2016)) %>%
  mutate(negbin_predictions=round(negbin_predictions)) %>%
  select(Country,Medal2016,negbin_predictions,Absolute_Error) %>%
  mutate(Absolute_Error=round(Absolute_Error)) %>%
  filter(Absolute_Error>12.62)%>%
  arrange(desc(Absolute_Error))
```
Mean absolute error and RMSE of the model:

```{r}
#Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error
mae(df$Medal2016,negbin_predictions)
rmse(df$Medal2016,negbin_predictions)
```
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $73.42$ and $561.33$ respectively.

## Task 5:
The best model can be selected using several metrics like **Mean absolute error** and **Root Mean Square Error**.The library(Metrics) is used to calculate it.

MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Itâ€™s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight.

The formula of MAE is given by:
$MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}|e_t|$
where, $e_t$ is the difference between predicted and observed values.

RMSE is a quadratic scoring rule that also measures the average magnitude of the error. Itâ€™s the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation

The formula of RMSE is given by:
$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^{n}e_t^2}$
where, $e_t$ is the difference between predicted and observed values.

We can also see the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed values for all the models. $cor()$ function can be used to find it.
```{r}
cor(df$Medal2016,pred)
cor(df$Medal2016,log_predictions)
cor(df$Medal2016,poi_predictions)
cor(df$Medal2016,negbin_predictions)
```

The MAE and RMSE of all the models have been calculated in the previous tasks. It has been summarised below:

Model 1: Linear Regression
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $6.1043$ and $9.11$ respectively which shows the model is performing decently but better than rest of the models. Correlation between predicted and actual values is $0.88$.


Model 2: Linear Regression for log-transformed medal counts
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $13.70$ and $56.62$ respectively which shows the model isn't performing better than the previous one. Correlation between predicted and actual values is $0.71$.


Model 3: Poisson Regression
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $7.85$ and $11.80$ respectively. The values are smaller than than log-transformed medal counts model but the performance is still not good. Also, it has more number of absolute error outliers than Model 2 but the correlation between predicted and actual values is $0.79$, which is more than Model 2. 


Model 4: Negative Binomial Regression
The value of mean absolute error and RMSE is $73.42$ and $561.33$ respectively. The values are largest compared to all the models. Also, the values of absolute error outliers are largest. Correlation between predicted and actual values is $0.67$.

If metrics of all the models are compared, the **Model 1 turns out to be the best one.** It has the the smallest MAE and RMSE value. It could predict our target variable $Medal2016$ with better accuracy compared to rest of the models. Furthermore, Model 1 has least number of absolute error outliers and shows highest correlation between predicted and actual values. Model 4 was trained with optimal value of $theta$ but it was the least performing model with largest MAE and RMSE values. Model 1 still needs to be improved as its MAE and RMSE values are significant. It is only best compared to rest of the models. The plot shows that the data points are quite away from the regression line and there is significant difference between the predicted and observed values. Hence, none of the models can be said to have good accuracy.
